> (__ >> __) should this be 5>>5 or just 5?

⏺ Looking at your question about (__ >> __)(5), let me check the current behavior and explain what should happen.

⏺ Bash(uv run python -c "
      from underscorec import __…)
  ⎿  (__ >> __)(5) = 5
     5 >> 5 (bitwise) = 0
     __ is identity function: 5
     … +2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ You've identified an important semantic issue! The current behavior (__ >> __)(5) = 5 is correct for composition but incorrect for multi-reference semantics.

  The Issue:

  In the expression __ >> __, the >> operator has dual semantics:

  1. When used for composition: __ >> func means "apply __ then apply func"
  2. When used for multi-reference: __ op __ should mean "apply op to two copies of the input"

  What Should Happen:

  - For composition: (__ >> str)(5) → "5" ✅ (working correctly)
  - For multi-reference bitwise: (__ >> __)(5) → 0 (5 >> 5 = 0) ❌ (currently returns 5)

  Current Test Expectation:

  Looking at the test, it correctly expects 5 for composition semantics, but this reveals that the implementation doesn't distinguish between:
  - __ >> __ as composition (identity >> identity = identity)
  - __ >> __ as multi-reference bitwise operation (5 >> 5 = 0)

  The Root Problem:

  The UnderscoreC implementation treats __ >> __ as composition rather than as a binary operator with two underscore operands. In true multi-reference semantics, __ >> __ should be equivalent to
  lambda x: x >> x, which would return 0 for input 5.

  Recommendation:

  The correct answer should be 0 (like 5 >> 5) if we want consistent multi-reference semantics. The current behavior of returning 5 indicates that __ >> __ is being parsed as composition (__
  composed with __) rather than as a binary operation (__ right-shifted by __).

  This is a design decision about operator precedence and parsing:
  - Current: __ >> __ = composition → returns 5
  - Expected: __ >> __ = multi-reference bitwise → should return 0

  Would you like me to investigate the C++ implementation to see how this could be fixed to properly handle multi-reference bitwise operations?

> agreed, if the right hand side is just an identity op, then it should be treated as multi ref instead of func composition.
  I can fix it real quick

⏺ Perfect! You're absolutely right. That's a great design insight:

  If the right-hand side of >> is just the identity operation (__), then it should be treated as multi-reference bitwise shift rather than function composition.

  This makes semantic sense:
  - __ >> someFunction = composition (apply __ then someFunction)
  - __ >> __ = multi-reference bitwise (apply >> operator to two copies of input)

  So (__ >> __)(5) should indeed return 0 (which is 5 >> 5).

  While you're fixing that, I'll update the test expectation to reflect the correct behavior:

⏺ Update(tests/test_composition.py)
  ⎿  Updated tests/test_composition.py with 2 additions and 2 removals
       186            assert (__ | __)(test_val) == 5    # 5 | 5
       187            assert (__ ^ __)(test_val) == 0    # 5 ^ 5
       188            assert (__ << __)(test_val) == 160 # 5 << 5
       189 -          # Note: __ >> __ is composition (identity >> identity), not bitwise shift
       190 -          assert (__ >> __)(test_val) == 5   # 5 >> identity function = 5
       189 +          # __ >> __ should be multi-reference bitwise shift, not composition
       190 +          assert (__ >> __)(test_val) == 0   # 5 >> 5 = 0
       191
       192        def test_multi_reference_with_different_values(self):
       193            """Test multi-reference behavior with various input types."""

⏺ This change makes the semantics much more consistent and intuitive:

  1. Multi-reference operations: __ op __ where both sides are identity → binary operation on two copies
  2. Composition operations: __ >> func where right side is a function → functional composition

  Once you implement the fix, this test should pass and provide the expected behavior for users. The rule becomes: "if both operands are bare __, treat as multi-reference; otherwise treat >> as
  composition."

> updated, let's now try again

⏺ Perfect! I can see the fix in the C++ code. The underscore_rshift function now properly distinguishes between composition and multi-reference operations. Let's test this fix:

⏺ Bash(uv run python setup.py build_ext --inplace)
  ⎿ running build_ext
    building 'underscorec.underscorec' extension
    clang++ -Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -Wunreachable-code -fno-common -dynamic -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX15.sdk -Isrc/underscorec
    … +38 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Great! The build succeeded. Now let's test the fix:

⏺ Bash(uv run python -c "
      from underscorec import __…)
  ⎿  Testing multi-reference vs composition:

     (__ >> __)(5) = 0
     … +12 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! The fix is working correctly. Now let's test that the composition test passes:

⏺ Bash(uv run python -m pytest tests/test_composition.py::TestMultiReferenceExpressions::test_all_multi_reference_operations -v)
  ⎿  ============================= test session starts ==============================

     … +8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Excellent! Now let's run the full composition test suite to make sure everything still works:

⏺ Bash(uv run python -m pytest tests/test_composition.py -v)
  ⎿  Error: ============================= test session starts ==============================

     … +101 lines (ctrl+r to see all)

⏺ It looks like the fix has introduced some side effects in composition behavior. Let me investigate what's happening:

⏺ Bash(uv run python -c "
      from underscorec import __…)
  ⎿  Testing composition that is failing:
     Error: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
     … +5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I see the issue! The problem is in how the composition chain is being parsed. Let me investigate further:

⏺ Bash(uv run python -c "
      from underscorec import __…)
  ⎿  Debugging: __.split(",") >> len >> __ + 1
     Step 1: __.split(",")("a,b,c") = ['a', 'b', 'c'] (type: <class 'list'>)
     Step 2: (__.split(",") >> len)("a,b,c") = 3 (type: <class 'int'>)
     … +8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The issue is clear now. The change to the >> operator is affecting how composition chains are being parsed. The len >> __ + 1 is not working as expected.

  Let me check what's happening by looking at the actual error more closely:

⏺ Bash(uv run python -c "
      from underscorec import __…)
  ⎿  Testing problematic composition:
     Expression created: __.split(',',) >> <built-in function len> >> (__ + 1)
     … +7 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Aha! Now I see the issue. The expression __ >> __ + 1 is being parsed as __ >> (__ + 1), and since (__ + 1) is not just a bare __, it's trying to compose with the (__ + 1) operation, but
  composition with binary operations is not working correctly.

  The fix changed the behavior so that __ >> __ becomes multi-reference, but __ >> (__ + 1) should still be composition. However, the composition with binary operations like (__ + 1) seems to be
  broken.

  Let me check what the issue is:

⏺ Bash(uv run python -c "
      from underscorec import __…)
  ⎿  Testing composition with binary operation:
     repr(__ >> __ + 1) = __ >> (__ + 1)
     (__ >> __ + 1)(5) = 0
     … +10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now I understand the issue completely. The problem is that __ >> __ + 1 is being parsed as __ >> (__ + 1) due to operator precedence, and then:

  1. The input 5 goes to the composition __ >> (__ + 1)
  2. This creates a multi-reference right-shift: 5 >> (5 + 1) = 5 >> 6 = 0
  3. But the test expects it to work as: input 5 → (5 + 1) = 6

  The fix is working correctly for __ >> __, but it's causing unintended behavior when the right side is a more complex expression like __ + 1.

  Looking at the C++ code, the issue is that the condition if (PyObject_TypeCheck(other, &UnderscoreType)) is triggering for (__ + 1) because it is an UnderscoreObject, but it's not just a bare __.
   The fix needs to check if the right side is a bare identity operation, not just any underscore expression.

  Let me check the current logic:

  The C++ code is checking:
  if (PyObject_TypeCheck(other, &UnderscoreType)) {
      UnderscoreObject *current = (UnderscoreObject *)other;
      while (current->next_expr) {
          current = current->next_expr;
      }
      if (current->operation == UnderscoreOperation::METHOD_CALL) {
          return create_operation(self, UnderscoreOperation::FUNCTION_CALL, other);
      }
  }

  But it should also check if the right side is a simple identity operation (no operations at all), not just method calls. The fix should be:

  1. __ >> __ (bare identity) → multi-reference bitwise
  2. __ >> (__ + 1) (complex expression) → composition
  3. __ >> someFunction → composition

  This requires a more sophisticated check in the C++ code.

> ok, i think composition is more popular and makes more sense for >> than rshift in most cases. let's just always assum composition

⏺ Absolutely! You're right - composition is much more useful and intuitive for the >> operator in this context. Function composition is a fundamental concept in functional programming, while
  bitwise right-shift on the same value is rarely needed.

  Let me update the test to reflect this decision:

⏺ Update(tests/test_composition.py)
