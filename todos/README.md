## Performance Context

Based on benchmark analysis:
- **Strengths**: Excellent PyTorch integration (up to 2.5x faster), near-native NumPy performance
- **Weaknesses**: 2x overhead for simple Python operations, device transfer issues
- **Best Use Cases**: Data science/ML pipelines, complex data transformations
- **Current Bottlenecks**: Function call overhead, GPU synchronization issues

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: Reduce Python operation overhead from 2x to <1.5x
- **Reliability**: Zero performance regressions in CI/CD
- **Usability**: Clear error messages and comprehensive documentation
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system for new optimization backends
- **Adoption**: Improved performance characteristics enable broader use cases
